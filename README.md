CyOps is a set of vulnerable virtual machines used by the University of Gloucestershire as a part of our Applicant Day activity allowing
them to have a hands-on experience of what the course consists of.

 ***This project was exhibited at CRESTCON 2019***

# Development Team

This project was developed by the Team CyOps and Dr. Thu Yein Win (Thomas) on behalf of the University of Gloucestershire.

<i>Team Leader:</i>
    Dr. Thu Yein Win (Thomas)

<i>The Vulnerable Webserver:</i>
    Harry Barron

<i>The Vulnerable Target Linux Machine:</i>
    Kieren Stanton

<i>Social Engineering Profiles:</i>
    James Briggs
    
<i>Story and Plot Design:</i>
    Cassey Beach, Jack Sperduti, Molly Dewis, Nathen Davies
    
The Task consists of 3 components, two of which are Targets of Evaluation - A vulnerable webserver and a Linux machine. The other component features a set of social media pages which are used in the social engineering part of the activity.

To complete the tasks, applicants must:
 * Obtain login credentials to the linux machine via the webserver,
 * Decode the aquired log-in credentials to plaintext,
 * Using knowledge of network and port scanning, obtain access to the linux machine,
 * Investigate the Linux machine to obtain information relating to the brief,
 * Develop a full report outlining all of the information obtained.


# Prerequisites

You need to have VirtualBox installed in order to run the virtual machines and a basic knowledge of linux terminal commands.


N.B. Ensure all virtual machines are configured with an internal network adapter and a bridged adapter, allowing all on the premiscuous mode setting.
